# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) – Liminal Dreams (LD)

## 1. What is Liminal Dreams?
Liminal Dreams is a Web3 platform on HyperEVM that combines NFTs, $LD tokens, and AI agents. Users can mint NFTs for optional $LD airdrops and create AI agents by paying $LD tokens. All activity is tracked by x402Scan for transparency.

---

## 2. Do I need an NFT to create an AI agent?
No. NFTs are **optional** and mainly used for claiming $LD airdrops. AI agents can be created **purely by paying $LD tokens**.

---

## 3. How do I create an AI agent?
1. Pay the required amount of $LD tokens via the designated payment method.  
2. x402Scan detects the payment automatically.  
3. Once payment is confirmed, x402Scan deploys your AI agent on HyperEVM.

## 4. What does x402Scan do?
x402Scan is the engine that:  
- Detects $LD payments  
- Deploys AI agents automatically  
- Tracks agent activity  
- Provides analytics and transparency for developers and users

---

## 5. Can I pay in anything other than $LD?
No. Currently, **$LD is the only accepted payment token** for creating AI agents.

---

## 6. Are AI agents staked?
No. There is **no staking** involved. Users simply pay $LD tokens to create agents.

---

## 7. What can AI agents do?
AI agents execute **predefined on-chain tasks**. The initial agent types may include trading bots, automation scripts, or custom task agents. Performance-based $LD rewards may be implemented in the future.

---

## 8. How do I track my AI agent and payment history?
All payments and agent activity are tracked on **x402Scan**, which provides dashboards and analytics for transparency.

---

## 9. How do I claim $LD airdrops?
If you own a **Liminal Mint Pass NFT**, you are eligible for $LD airdrops. NFT ownership is verified on-chain and $LD tokens are distributed accordingly.

---

## 10. Can I use multiple NFTs or $LD payments to create multiple agents?
Yes. Each $LD payment detected by x402Scan can create a separate AI agent. NFT ownership is only relevant for claiming airdrops and does not affect agent creation.

---

## 11. Where can I find the smart contracts?
All contracts (ERC-20 $LD, AgentManager, and any auxiliary contracts) are stored in the **/contracts** folder of the GitHub repository.

---

## 12. Is Liminal Dreams secure?
Yes. Best practices are implemented:  
- OpenZeppelin ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards  
- x402Scan tracks payments and agent creation to prevent duplication or fraud
