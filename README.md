# Liminal Dreams (LD)

**Network:** HyperEVM  
**Core Concept:** Users mint NFTs on OpenSea to claim $LD airdrops (optional). AI agents are created by **paying $LD tokens**, with creation handled by **x402Scan**. x402Scan also tracks all agent activity and payments for transparency.

## Features
- NFT Mint Pass (ERC-721) via OpenSea (optional)
- $LD Token (ERC-20)
- AI Agent creation via **payment in $LD**
- x402Scan integration for agent creation, payment tracking, and analytics

## How It Works
1. Mint NFT on OpenSea (optional, for airdrop)
2. Pay $LD tokens to create AI agent
3. x402Scan detects payment and deploys AI agent
4. Agent executes on-chain tasks
5. Track activity and payments via x402Scan
