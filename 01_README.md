# Liminal Dreams (LD)

**Network:** HyperEVM  

## Introduction

Liminal Dreams is a next-generation Web3 platform that combines NFTs, token incentives, and AI-powered agents. Users can mint NFTs on OpenSea to claim $LD token airdrops, while $LD tokens themselves are used to create intelligent AI agents that perform predefined on-chain tasks. 

The platform leverages **x402Scan** to automatically detect $LD payments, deploy AI agents, and track all activity, providing full transparency and analytics.  

By separating NFT utility from AI agent creation, Liminal Dreams ensures a simple, secure, and scalable system where users only need to pay $LD to deploy AI agents. The NFT is optional and primarily serves as a way to reward early supporters through airdrops.  

### Key Benefits
- **Accessible AI Agents:** Create AI agents by simply paying $LD tokens; no staking or complex setup required.  
- **Transparent and Trackable:** All payments and agent activity are logged via x402Scan.  
- **Optional NFT Rewards:** NFT holders can claim $LD airdrops and gain early access to the ecosystem.  
- **Modular and Scalable:** Designed to integrate additional agent types, NFTs, and token utilities in the future.  

## Features
- NFT Mint Pass (ERC-721) via OpenSea (optional)
- $LD Token (ERC-20)
- AI Agent creation via **payment in $LD**
- x402Scan integration for agent creation, payment tracking, and analytics

## How It Works
1. Mint NFT on OpenSea (optional, for $LD airdrop)
