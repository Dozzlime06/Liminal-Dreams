# Security & Best Practices

- Ensure x402Scan reliably detects $LD payments
- Track $LD payments and agent assignments to prevent duplication or fraud
- Test agent deployment on HyperEVM testnet before mainnet
- Use OpenZeppelin standards for ERC-20 and ERC-721 contracts
- Optional: monitor agent activity for abnormal behavior
